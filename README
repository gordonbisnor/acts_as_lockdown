ActsAsLockdown
=============

Allows the lockdown of specified attributes when a record enters a certain state machine state. If for example a record beings in the "pending" state and then enters a "published" state, at that point it may be necessary to insure that a certain number of attributes are frozen from change. Works by block the setter method if the record responds a query about the record state to e.g. self.published?
